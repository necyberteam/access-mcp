## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard and open-source framework introduced by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. It provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts, creating a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to integrate and share data. MCP has been widely adopted by major AI providers and the broader community.


## ACCESS MCP Servers offer structured access to:

- **Infrastructure Resources** Query hardware specifications, system capabilities, and availability across ACCESS resources.
- **System Status** Track outages, maintenance schedules, and system announcements in real time.
- **Software Discovery** Search and browse software packages available on ACCESS-CI resources.
- **XDMoD Metrics** Access usage analytics, visualize trends with charts, and review resource utilization data.
- **Affinity Groups** Connect with communities, discover events, and access knowledge base resources.
- **Allocations** Browse active research projects, identify collaboration opportunities, and analyze allocation trends.
- **Events** Find workshops, webinars, and training sessions, with filters for date, type, skill level, and topic.
- **Announcements** Announcements from the community.

## Quick Example

With ACCESS-CI MCP servers, you can ask Claude:

> "What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI and what machine learning software do they have?"

Claude will query multiple MCP servers to provide comprehensive information about:

- Available GPU-enabled systems
- Hardware specifications
- Installed ML frameworks and libraries
- Current system status and availability

## Try It Now

Connect your AI assistant to ACCESS-CI services in seconds.

### Claude Desktop / claude.ai

1. Open **Customize** > **Connectors** > **Add custom connector**
2. Paste a server URL (e.g., `https://mcp.access-ci.org/compute-resources/sse`)
3. Repeat for each server — see the [**Getting Started guide**](/getting-started) for all URLs

No software to install. Claude will offer to authenticate with your ACCESS credentials via CILogon for tools that manage content.

Ask: *"What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI?"*

### Claude Code / Other MCP Clients

See the [**Getting Started guide**](/getting-started) for setup commands and configuration.
