## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to securely access external data sources. ACCESS-CI MCP servers provide structured access to:

- **Community data** from affinity groups and events
- **Resource information** about compute systems and capabilities  
- **Real-time status** of system health and maintenance
- **Software catalogs** across different ACCESS resources

## Quick Example

With ACCESS-CI MCP servers, you can ask Claude:

> "What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI and what machine learning software do they have?"

Claude will query multiple MCP servers to provide comprehensive information about:
- Available GPU-enabled systems
- Hardware specifications 
- Installed ML frameworks and libraries
- Current system status and availability

## Two Ways to Use

### 📥 For End Users
Download pre-built executables and add to Claude Desktop - no technical setup required.

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/your-repo/releases)

### 🔧 For Developers  
Install as npm packages for custom integrations and applications.

```bash
npm install @access-mcp/affinity-groups
```

## Supported by ACCESS-CI

These MCP servers are built to work with official ACCESS-CI APIs and are designed to help researchers more effectively discover and utilize cyberinfrastructure resources.
