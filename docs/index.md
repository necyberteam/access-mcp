## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard and open-source framework introduced by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. It provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts, creating a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to integrate and share data. MCP has been widely adopted by major AI providers and the broader community.


## ACCESS MCP Servers

ACCESS-CI MCP servers offer structured access to:

- **Infrastructure Resources** Query hardware specifications, system capabilities, and availability across ACCESS resources.
- **System Status** Track outages, maintenance schedules, and system announcements in real time.
- **Software Discovery** Search and browse software packages available on ACCESS-CI resources.
- **XDMoD Metrics** Access usage analytics, visualize trends with charts, and review resource utilization data.
- **Affinity Groups** Connect with communities, discover events, and access knowledge base resources.
- **Allocations** Browse active research projects, identify collaboration opportunities, and analyze allocation trends.
- **Events** Find workshops, webinars, and training sessions, with filters for date, type, skill level, and topic.

## Quick Example

With ACCESS-CI MCP servers, you can ask Claude:

> "What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI and what machine learning software do they have?"

Claude will query multiple MCP servers to provide comprehensive information about:

- Available GPU-enabled systems
- Hardware specifications
- Installed ML frameworks and libraries
- Current system status and availability

## Installation

Install all ACCESS-CI MCP servers with one command (requires Node.js 18+):

```bash
npm install -g @access-mcp/affinity-groups @access-mcp/compute-resources @access-mcp/system-status @access-mcp/software-discovery @access-mcp/xdmod-metrics @access-mcp/allocations @access-mcp/events
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "access-affinity-groups": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/affinity-groups"]
    },
    "access-compute-resources": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/compute-resources"]
    },
    "access-system-status": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/system-status"]
    },
    "access-software-discovery": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/software-discovery"],
      "env": {
        "SDS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    },
    "access-xdmod-metrics": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/xdmod-metrics"],
      "env": {
        "XDMOD_API_TOKEN": "your-xdmod-api-token"
      }
    },
    "access-allocations": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/allocations"]
    },
    "access-events": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@access-mcp/events"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”§ For Developers

Install locally for custom integrations:

```bash
npm install @access-mcp/affinity-groups
```

## Supported by ACCESS-CI

These MCP servers are built to work with official ACCESS-CI APIs and are designed to help researchers more effectively discover and utilize cyberinfrastructure resources.
