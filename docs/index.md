## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI assistants to securely interact with external data sources.  

ACCESS-CI MCP servers offer structured access to:

- **Resource information** about compute systems and capabilities
- **Real-time status** of system health and maintenance
- **Software catalogs** across different ACCESS resources
- **Usage analytics** and computational resource utilization metrics
- **Community data** from affinity groups and events
- **Research projects** and allocation data for collaboration discovery

## Quick Example

With ACCESS-CI MCP servers, you can ask Claude:

> "What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI and what machine learning software do they have?"

Claude will query multiple MCP servers to provide comprehensive information about:

- Available GPU-enabled systems
- Hardware specifications
- Installed ML frameworks and libraries
- Current system status and availability
