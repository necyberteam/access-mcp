## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI assistants to securely interact with external data sources.

ACCESS-CI MCP servers offer structured access to:

- **Resource information** about compute systems and capabilities
- **Real-time status** of system health and maintenance
- **Software catalogs** across different ACCESS resources
- **Usage analytics** and computational resource utilization metrics
- **Community data** from affinity groups and knowledge bases
- **Research projects** and allocation data for collaboration discovery
- **Training events** with workshops, webinars, and learning opportunities

## Quick Example

With ACCESS-CI MCP servers, you can ask Claude:

> "What GPU resources are available on ACCESS-CI and what machine learning software do they have?"

Claude will query multiple MCP servers to provide comprehensive information about:

- Available GPU-enabled systems
- Hardware specifications
- Installed ML frameworks and libraries
- Current system status and availability

## Getting Started

Ready to explore ACCESS-CI resources with AI assistance? Get started in just a few minutes:

### What You'll Need
- **Claude Desktop** - Free AI assistant app with MCP support
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) - Comes with Node.js for easy installation

### Quick Install
```bash
npm install -g @access-mcp/affinity-groups @access-mcp/compute-resources @access-mcp/system-status @access-mcp/software-discovery @access-mcp/xdmod-charts @access-mcp/xdmod-data @access-mcp/allocations @access-mcp/nsf-awards @access-mcp/events
```

### Quick Setup
1. **Install Prerequisites** - Claude Desktop and npm
2. **Install MCP Servers** - One command installs all ACCESS-CI servers  
3. **Configure Claude** - Add servers to your configuration file
4. **Start Exploring** - Ask Claude about ACCESS-CI resources

### Authentication
- **Most servers work immediately** with no setup required
- **Some servers** may need API keys for full functionality
- Get started right away and add API keys as needed

### Docker Deployment
For production deployments, Docker containers are available:
