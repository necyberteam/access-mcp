## Common Usage Patterns

### System-Wide Overview
```typescript
{
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "none",
  statistic: "total_cpu_hours"
}
```

### Resource Comparison
```typescript
{
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "resource",
  statistic: "utilization"
}
```

### GPU Usage Analysis
```typescript
{
  realm: "SUPREMM",  // Important: Use SUPREMM for GPU!
  group_by: "resource",
  statistic: "gpu_time"
}
```

### User Activity
```typescript
{
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "person",
  statistic: "job_count"
}
```

### Institutional Analysis
```typescript
{
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "institution",
  statistic: "total_ace"
}
```

## Filter Options

Most chart requests support optional filters to narrow down results:

```typescript
{
  realm: "SUPREMM",
  group_by: "resource",
  statistic: "gpu_time",
  filters: {
    resource: "Bridges 2 GPU",
    person: "smith"
  }
}
```

**Common Filter Types:**
- `resource` - Specific compute resource (e.g., "Bridges 2 GPU", "Expanse")
- `person` - Specific user
- `pi` - Principal Investigator
- `institution` - Institution name
- `queue` - Scheduler queue
- `jobsize` - Job size category

## Display Options

### Dataset Types
- `timeseries` (default) - Time-based trending data
- `aggregate` - Summary/totals data

### Display Types
- `line` (default) - Line charts
- `bar` - Bar charts
- `pie` - Pie charts
- `scatter` - Scatter plots

### Combine Types
- `side` (default) - Side-by-side comparison
- `stack` - Stacked values
- `percent` - Percentage breakdown

### Log Scale
- `n` (default) - Linear scale
- `y` - Logarithmic scale

## Example Usage

### Monthly CPU Usage Trend
```typescript
get_chart_data({
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "none",
  statistic: "total_cpu_hours",
  start_date: "2024-01-01",
  end_date: "2024-01-31",
  dataset_type: "timeseries"
})
```

### GPU Usage by Resource
```typescript
get_chart_data({
  realm: "SUPREMM",
  group_by: "resource",
  statistic: "gpu_time",
  start_date: "2024-01-01",
  end_date: "2024-01-31",
  dataset_type: "aggregate"
})
```

### Institution Utilization Comparison
```typescript
get_chart_data({
  realm: "Jobs",
  group_by: "institution",
  statistic: "utilization",
  start_date: "2024-01-01",
  end_date: "2024-03-31",
  limit: 10
})
```
