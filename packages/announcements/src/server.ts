BEFORE CALLING:
1. Call get_announcement_context to check coordinator status.
2. Gather information - either conversationally OR by parsing pasted content:
   - title (required): Clear, specific headline
   - body (required): Full content with details, dates, links. HTML supported.
   - summary (required): 1-2 sentence teaser for listings
   - tags (required): Call suggest_tags with the body text, then pass the returned english tag NAMES (the "name" field) as the tags array. Never pass ids or uuids.
   - affiliation (optional): "ACCESS Collaboration" or "Community" (default)
   - external_link (if relevant): URL and link text for external references
3. IF user is a coordinator (check get_announcement_context response):
   - affinity_group: Ask which group to associate with
   - where_to_share: Ask preferences (defaults: Announcements page + Bi-Weekly Digest)

WORKFLOW:
If user pastes content (event description, draft text, etc.):
1. Call get_announcement_context
2. Parse the pasted content to extract title, body, dates, links, etc.
3. Call suggest_tags with the body text — include returned tag names in the tags parameter
4. Call suggest_summary with the body text if no summary provided
5. Ask only about missing/unclear fields
6. If coordinator: ask about affinity group and where to share
7. Show preview (including tags) and get confirmation
8. Create the announcement with ALL fields including tags

If user describes what they want conversationally:
1. Call get_announcement_context
2. Guide them through providing title, body, summary
3. Call suggest_tags with the body text — include returned tag names in the tags parameter
4. If coordinator: ask about affinity group and where to share
5. Show preview (including tags) and get confirmation
6. Create the announcement with ALL fields including tags

IMPORTANT: Always pass the tags parameter when creating. Tags are english NAMES (strings) taken verbatim from the "name" field of suggest_tags — pass them as the tags array. Never pass ids or uuids; the tool resolves names internally.

PREVIEW FORMAT (show before creating):
---
**Title:** [title]
**Summary:** [summary or "None provided"]
**Body:**
[body content, truncate if very long]

**Tags:** [tag1, tag2, ...] or "None"
**Affiliation:** [affiliation or "Community (default)"]
**External Link:** [link text](url) or omit if none
[If coordinator:]
**Affinity Group:** [group name] or "None"
**Share to:** [list of selected options]
---
Ask "Does this look correct?" before creating.

Once you provide the content, I'll suggest relevant tags and generate a summary automatically.

**Required Information:**

1. **Title** - A clear, concise title (under 100 characters)

2. **Body** - The main content (HTML supported)

**Recommended:**

3. **Summary** - Brief teaser (1-2 sentences) for listings

4. **Tags** - Help users find your announcement (1-6 recommended)

**Optional:**

5. **Affiliation** - "ACCESS Collaboration" or "Community" (default)

6. **External Link** - If referencing external content

**For Affinity Group Coordinators:**
- Associate with your affinity group
- Choose where to share (Announcements page, Bi-Weekly Digest, Affinity Group page, Email to group)

**Important:** Announcements are created as **drafts** requiring staff review. You'll receive an edit URL.

Let me check your context first, then we'll get started!${topic ? `\n\nI see you want to announce something about "${topic}" - I'll help you craft that.` : ""}`,

**View Your Announcements**
Use \`get_my_announcements\` to see all announcements you've created, including:
- Draft announcements awaiting review
- Published announcements
- Their current status

**Update an Announcement**
Use \`update_announcement\` with the announcement's UUID to modify:
- Title
- Body content
- Summary
- Published date
- Tags

**Delete an Announcement**
Use \`delete_announcement\` with the UUID to remove an announcement you own.

Would you like me to:
1. **List your announcements** - See what you've created
2. **Update a specific announcement** - Make changes to an existing one
3. **Delete an announcement** - Remove one you no longer need

Which would you like to do?`,
